# CryptoGuard Pro

CryptoGuard Pro is a Python encryption and decryption toolset that provides user-friendly methods for encrypting and decrypting text using RSA and AES encryption algorithms. It also includes the ability to save and load RSA keys for secure communication and data storage.

## Features

- **RSA Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt text using RSA encryption with public and private keys.

- **AES Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt text using AES encryption with a secret key.

- **Key Management**: Save and load RSA keys for future use.

## Installation

CryptoGuard Pro requires Python 3 and the `pycryptodome` library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```bash

How to Use
Run the CryptoGuard Pro.py script.

Choose an option from the menu:

1 for RSA encryption
2 for RSA decryption
3 for AES encryption
4 for AES decryption
5 to save RSA keys
6 to load RSA keys
7 to exit
Follow the prompts to enter text or key information.
